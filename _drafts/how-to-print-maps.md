# How to make maps that you can print?

Go on that website http://printmaps-osm.de/en/index.html and upload a config file such as template_map.yaml

In its standard version you can choose between looks and resolution.

The Style: schwarzplan+ is a good clean design in almost black and white.

# How to make maps that you can print with gpx traces added to map?

Basically same process as above but additional files added. The additional files are the single gpx traces that need to be mentionned in the config file as the template_map_and_gpx_traces.yaml
