### **Who am I?**
I'm a color and computer vision scientist. I did obtain my PhD in signal and image processing in 2007. I did my research in Norway at the now called [The Norwegian Colour and Visual Computing Laboratory][link-colorlab] while being registered in Paris at the now called [Telecom ParisTech][link-enst]. 

I was based in Norway for my research, 2003 to 2007, in 2008 I moved to Berlin where I lived and worked up to 2017. In the summer of this same year I moved to Montreal to join the startup [IRYStec][link-irystec], but originally I'm from Paris where I was born in the holy year 1977.

At IRYStec I experienced the almost down of another startup for finally being acquired a few hours before we ran out of money. We did enter the first COVID wave as part of [Faurecia which turned into FORVIA][link-forvia], increasing the size of the company from 20 to more than 100000 employes all over the world. There I started to work on display for mobiles to continue working on display for cars.

I became permanent resident of Canada in 2022, same year I changed work to join [DNEG][link-dneg] which let me go in May 2024. There I worked on the color pipeline of the studio, in other words color management.

###  **Background**
My research was about multi-spectral color reproduction or how to make perfect copy of a painting. This being possible if you have in your hands a spectral image of your painting, a printer with several inks/colorants and their spectral properties. The rest is mathematic, geometry, optimization, printing technology, halftoning, color science, human color perception... The pdf of my thesis is available [here][link-thesis].

After my thesis I have been working as an applied scientist in one of the Fraunhofer Institutes in Berlin called [FOKUS][link-viscom]. The topics were a mix of color correction, immersive display, medical imaging, computer vision, feature points tracking, machine learning-ish, human color perception, VR, image stitching, you name it.

In the few startups in Berlin I worked on computer vision, AI, immersive content, image stitching and NLP projects. I can say my experiences in those environments weren't the best, but while moving back to Montreal (I did one year exchange for my master in 2000-2001) and joining yet another startup the experience was more fruitfull: at IRYStec I worked on perceptual display, color vision deficiency, display technologies and more.

### **What else?**
I like to believe that I'm not only an applied scientist and I try to maintain an art practise in parallel. Some of my visual art works can be seen on my [cargo website][link-cargocollective] or my [instagram][link-instagram].
