# Eighth Season for RunRite 

Let's review this year of [RunRite][runrite-link] in graphs and data, and let's try to answer of few questions such as:
+ How long did we run?
+ What was the longest run?
+ Where did we run?
+ Why did we run?

I'm collecting data for all runs, so each Thursday I'm archiving the path of the week (a *.gpx* file). It changes each week except that we start and come back from and to the same place. And for the last 3 to 4 years we started from [Espace Ciele][ciele-link]. 

We will go up, reach the top of Westmount or Mt-Royal or both depending of how the front of the pack feels it. We run 9 to 13km each time at least.

# How long did we run?
A graph showing the run distances per run since the beginning of RunRite.

Same graph as above but only focusing on season 2024-2025, interesting to see some kind of periodicity.

# What was the longest run?
How I get the value.

The distance...

The graph...

How long cumulated distance did this run club run since its beginning???


# Where did we run?
Graph showing where we did go during the year 2024-2025.

Same graph with in addition the centroid of each run, the marker in o has his size matched with the run length.

Similar graph combining all seasons, from top to bottom 2017 to 2025. It's a wip graph.

# Why did we run?

Absolutely no idea.
