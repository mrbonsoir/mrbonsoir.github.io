Year 2023 is a big running races year for me. Today is my third marathon and only three weeks passed since the last one. But the last one was a trail and I did recover faster than for a road race.

# During the race

Awake early to be ready for **7:45am** time of the race departure. The usual routine at home and zombie walk to the subway direction the Parc Jean Drapeaux.

This time I have decided to not change my running plan the day of the race! I find my pace group and try to stick to it: I aim for 3h45min.

First half is ok, the woman leading my pace group is talking to us, warning when to eat and drink, we just need to focus on running. And a good reminder: it really starts when 21km left on the full distance.

We are at the North end of the St-Laurent street, time to come back and I'm still ok. A bit slower than last year but I'm not crashing at 25k for changing.

At **35K** I have a cramp in one of my calves, I'm forced to stretch and to slow down. Going from average 5:25/km to 5:55/km for 4km until I managed to speed up. My last km is my fastest and I finish in **3h52min**.

As usual to see known faces and to feel the cheering is re-boosting my energy level during the race.

I was eating regularly along the race, drinking as well. But that crappy cramp...

# After the race

I'm less destroyed than last year, so not in good shape of course but it's better than last year. Probably the going to the gym once to twice a week did help.

I'm able to reach my place, take a shower, get some rest and go out again to meet a few runners and cheer squad members at a bar for some beers.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
