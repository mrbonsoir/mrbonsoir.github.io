Saturday morning in [Lachine][lachine-mtl-link]. I choose the bus to reach the race departure from St-Henri. In the bus a majority of people in jogging outfit with their bib, I'm in the right bus.

# During the race

Two loops and last two km into the Rene Levesque park. Most of the race path in Lachine along the water.

All conditions are reunited for a good performance, but I'm slow. An average speed just below 6min/km, a final time of **2h06min**.

# After the race

Not my best race, as I wrote I was slow, I can probably blame the temperature but it was mostly me being slow. 

But first race in Canada. I choose this one to prepapre my next marathon in Quebec city in October this year where the weather might be different.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
