*I did 7 loops plus extra to reach 50k. Basically I ran 40min each hour and had 15/20min to recover without getting cold. I was prepared from last year experience where I ran 5 loops and about 35km. And as last year the event is perfectly organised by [Courir Sans Ballon][CSB-link].*

# Second backyard ultra and first 50k ran in one day

The concept is simple, we all start at 9:00am and we run the same loop of 6.7km. You run at the speed you want but it should take less than an hour.

At each following hour 10:00am, 11:00am... we do it again. If you don't start again at each hour you are out. The race stops when only one runner remains. The race organisators have set up the limit to 12 loops which means 80km total and last loop departure at 8:00pm. It can last days when no loop limit is decided.

# During the race

Loop 1 to loop 3 I'm running with a buddy called Anders, we both did not know we were registered to the same event. So we run and chat, I may have talked with another runner I meet sometimes at various events here in Montreal.

From loop 4 we already lost some people. I managed to keep the same speed and having a podcast playing helps to kill the time.

Loop 5, same as last year! I have done 33km, I feel alright and am carefull to stay warm between the loops. Pasta and potatoes are now served and they are welcomed. Weather situation is correct, we see the blue sky for about 2 seconds between clouds which all stay very low. It's not cold but I'm layering up.

Loop 6 done and 40km reached! So far so good. I did change shirt, despite the 15-20min between loops I don't have time to dry, so new clothes are more than welcomed!

Loop 7 is hard, I pass the marathon distance and enter the ultra-marathon segment, everything above 42km. At 44k I alternate walk and run as my legs start to feel heavier, being near my goal distance my body is switching to *let's finish now* mode.

Back at the departure loop I have a smaller break and continue to reach a total of 50km, I'm slow and my legs are really heavy. But I made it! Glad to have join the event and to have my car not too far.

I ran almost at the same speed for 6 loops, last one being slower. I was less painfull than a traditionnal marathon and an interesting experience.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
