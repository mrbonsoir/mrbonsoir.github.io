Pretty excited about that one. It's the first official race I'm doing since the pandemic time is over and it's in Montreal.

Another change with my last marathon in 2019 is that when I'm not racing I'm also running in group, call it social run, community run, you are not alone run, as you wish. 

Also for the first time I don't have to travel to attend a race, it is located where I live and I know many people registered as well, we can all suffer in group. I also discover the *if you don't run, you cheer* approach of a race, a great way to participate to sport event.

# Day of the race

It's never a good sleep before a race day, but I slept in my bed. Breakfast, running clothes and directon Parc Jean Drapeaux by subway. Beautiful weather outside, already so much better than my marathon in Quebec city.

I felt fresh and probably too optimistic, meaning I start too fast and the first 20km to 25km are a real blast. Plus I see friends on the side of the path regularly, it helps as the part in the North of Montreal on St-Laurent is empty of everything.

From km 33 I alternate run and tiny walk, I discover new pains, this time it is in my upper body.

The closer you are to park Maisonneuve the longer it feels, and at the last turn in the opposite direction when we think we are arriving you can hear all runners screaming naaaannnnn.

Boost time at km 39 where many run clubs have setup their cheering station. The amoung of noise they are making is wonderfull and giving me so much energy, love it.

Last 2km painfull but manage to give a last kick. 

I cross the line and check my watch, so many PRs, very happy about that, a time of **3h58min15sec**, finally below 4h! A mix of joy for two thirds of the race and new pain to experience for the last third.

# After the race

I walk like a zombie, I try to stretch at home but my body is too stiff. It will take a few hours to cool down.

As usual it will be aslo the time to think of how I can improve my training. I felt good regarding the endurance, but so much body pain.

And perhaps I should not change running plan the morning of the race, a marathon is still a long race.


# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
