Less than a month after the marathon in Montreal I'm running the Toronto half-marathon for the first time.

I'm fully recovered from last race, so many runners form Montreal are there too and it feels like a fun group expedition.

# During the race

I'm sharing a room with two dudes, a Jordan and a Jean-Michel. 

Breakfast in our room, matching outfits and little jog to the departure race.

Nice weather again, I don't know how I will start the race so I start slowish.

Feeling good I push a bit and seing the number of km remaining I'm smilling as it will be so much faster than a marathon!

Many people along the running path, more than Montreal, a cool atmoshpere.

Around km 13 I still feel pretty good, I wave or high five with people I know on the side.

A time of **1h45min58sec** which is a great improvement comparing to my previous half-marathon, so happy! In my dream I want to keep that speed for a full marathon.

# After the race

Arrived by train and coming back to Montral by car with four dudes. Perhaps 4 burgers eaten since the race is over, AW and Burger King. 

A long and borring road to go back but turning very pleasant with my co-travellers talking about the next race... unsanctionned one, by night and organized by [runk][runk-link].

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
