# Before the race

It's the 50th anniversary of the Ottawa marathon and I succesfully missed the special offer for the registration. Good job.

Montreal Ottawa on Friday, two days before the race, car sharing with a Stephane.

A few events organized by local run groups until the race day. We - Montreal runners - felt pretty well welcomed.

I did a good move which is to stay at an hostel 500m from the departure line.  I'm 100% feeling a bit under the weather as we may say, had a good nap Saturday afternoon and don't know how it will go tomorrow.

# During the race

It was painful.

Actually it wasn't so painful, it was just long and hilly. The path did change versus last year as we did not wander in Gatineau.


I had to change my goals before the run because of being sick the last three days, I could not inhale totally without pain, so running fast (and I don't run fast so it's a fallacious comment) was impossible, decision was made to start slow, I let the bunnies 3h50, 3h55, 4h00 to pass me quick. Later the 4h10 up to 4h20 which I passed again before the arrival line.

From 0 to 33km going from a pace of 5:30 to 6:15 per km, so not a negative split, then a couple of 200m walk and 800m run then last 3km almost running and sipping a mimosa, less on my face this time but mimosa is disguting, I will have preferred a beer like last year.

I had 4 [xact][xact-link] bars, took half of it every 5-6km before each water stations. And no cramps which is a miracle.

**4h25min28sec** finally. Happy to finish in one piece.

# After the race

I joined the after party, had a beer or two but can't really eat anything. Again very good vibes for this after race party!

For the way back we are three plus a bike in the car. Happy to not have to drive.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
