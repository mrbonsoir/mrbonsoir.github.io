# Before the race

It's the 50th anniversary of the Ottawa marathon and I managed to miss the special offer for registration. Good job.

Montreal Ottawa on Friday, two days before the race, car sharing with a Stephane.

A few events organized by local run groups until the race day. We - Montreal runners - felt pretty well welcomed.

And I did a good move which is to stay at an hostel 500m from the departure line.  I'm 100% feeling a bit under the weather as we may say, had a good nap Saturday afternoon and don't how it will go tomorrow.

# During the race

It was painful.

Actually it wasn't so painful, it was just long and hilly.

I had to change my goals before the run because of being sick the last three days, I could not inhale totally without pain, so running fast (and I don't run fast so it's a fallacious comment) was impossible, decision was made to start slow, I let the bunnies 3:50, 3:55, 4:00 to pass me quick. Later the 4:10 up to 4:20 which I passed again before the arrival line.

From 0 to 33km going form 5:30 to 6:15, then a couple of 200m walk and 800m run then last 3km almost while running and sipping a mimosa.

I had 4 xact bar, took half of it every 5-6k before each water stations. And no cramps which is a miracle.

**4h25min28sec** finally. Happy to finish in one piece.

# After the race

I joined the after party, had a beer or two but can't really eat anything. Again very good vibes for this after race party!

For the way back we are three plus a bike in the car. Happy to not have to drive.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
