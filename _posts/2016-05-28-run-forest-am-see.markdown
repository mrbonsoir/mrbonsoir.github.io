Being on a wave of let's register to more run races I did register with a friend to another half-marathon. We found nothing in Berlin itself but almost 150km South-West around Bitterfeld we found one: it will be a race around a lake.

Thanks to the limitless speed limit in Germany we arrive in time at destination. An outdoor stadium, one building and about 200 runners. Family atmosphere and we must be the only non locals.

# During the race

**6pm** a bus has dropped us a few kilometers away from the arrival as the lake circumference is longer than 21km.

The path follows a bike way of good asphalt between house and the lake. 

It's a group departure after the official did shot with a gun in the air. Quickly speed groups are formed and the two races 10km and 21km diverge, from that 15km left and I'm alone.

I'm not totally alone, two or tree runners pass me but I will take them over before the finish line.

We have long straigth lines to do, always turning right and using our hands to get rid of some wasps here and there, a good way to stay in movement.

Half is done, it's sunny and hot, despite some parts in gravel it't comfortable to run but very monotonous, only changes I see when I look away is the next km signs of the race.

The 14km distance is passed, cramps are knocking on my calves doors but they are strong and let the door closed. I feel good and slowly come back on the people that took me over earlier.

**8:01pm** I'm leaving the forest, passing an official with a speaker transmitting my bib number to the arrival such that I can hear my name when entering the station for the last stretch, cool.

I found my friend at the foodtruck with a bred and a German sausage in his hand. I get inspired.

# After the race
I'm laying on the grass in the middle of the stadium, chilling under the sunset, and got called on the speaker to join the podium, my first, as I finished third in my category! We were perhaps four...

**9:14pm** more chilling before aiming back to Berlin. The champagne for runner is drunk, I mean beer, time to hit the road.

A time of **2h01min59sec** which isn't exceptionnal, but I really enjoy this race. It changed from the airport runs.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
