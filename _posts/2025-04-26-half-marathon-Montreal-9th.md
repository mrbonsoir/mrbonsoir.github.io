First running race of the season. It's still cold outside, but not only, it's also raining, a lot.

The race follows the same path as the race last year.

# During the race

Before the departure I'm dressed like Harry Tuttle almost.

I spot the rabbit 1h45min in my corral and decide to position myself in front of him.

I start faster than I planned but it's cold, so I get warmer quickly. I have removed my raining trouser just before the start of the race and will throw it away a few meters later, I will also find it back at the end of the race.

I passed the 7km in shape, that was my test to see how I will do this race.

I managed to stop at the mimosa corner arond km 10, drunk mine and go again, a wise move this year to stop for zipping this beverage, but anyway my face and my whole body is already wet.

Around km 15 the rabbit is joining me and I try to stay close to him.

I kept the speed and managed to finish in **1h45min15sec**, wet, exhausted but happy to have survived this swim run.

The last three semi-marathons I ran were in those times 1h45min +/- 1min but that one is the one I felt the most comfortable.


# After the race

Freaking cold, chaos to get your bag back, no place to change where you are protected from the rain, lovely. Luckily I avoid hyportermia, but I saw so many runners almost blue after pacing the finish line.

One burger, one beer for brunch, trying to not get sick, see some people arriving for the 5k and 10k races and back home for a warm shower.

And a solid nap with a cat on me did help a lot to recover.
