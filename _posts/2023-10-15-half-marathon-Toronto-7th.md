This concludes a crazy year of official run races.

Car sharing to Toronto with Daniel driving with Aurelie and me as passengers. The road is long but when you talk all along it passed pretty quickly.

We arrive Saturday early afternoon in Toronto from Montreal. Time to pick my bib and go on city exploration before a concert in the evening.

# During the race

What to say? It went well. As last year the feeling to start a race 50% shorter than a marathon is a real pleasure, especially a month or less after a marathon race.

I'm starting with Andrew who is feeling great as well but too fast for me. So after 2k he continues on his own pace. He will do a PR.

I remember from last year the last km is longer than I thought, the gps between the buildings has trouble to give the right location... But I managed to stay consistent and got also my PR in **1h44min18sec**.

# After the race

We will join the after race event with other run clubs from Toronto and Montreal. Good vibes, happy faces as many of us did great today.

And time to hit the road again, the three of us for a solid 6h hours of driving.

That was an expedition but that was cool. 

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
