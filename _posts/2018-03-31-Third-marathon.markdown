It has been two years since I took part in an official race. 

I changed country from Germany to Canada and I failed on my goal to do one marathon per year since the first one but I'm workin on it. 

I haven't stop running obviously, mostly alone and since summer 2017 I'm exploring Montreal and sometimes Los Angeles with my running shoes.

A few months ago a friend based in the Bay area proposed this [environsport][environ-link] event above the Golden Gate bridge, so we both registered. Only thing is we both discover the word *trail* in the event name a fews weeks before and later as a few hours before the race I discover my local friend had only signed for the half-marathon.

# Day of the race

**6:30am** my Lyft driver is bringing me from SF downtown to the Marin Headlands park just after the Golden Gate park. Dropped on the side of the road where it was indicated I walked 10min as planned and find the people building up the official departure/finish line.


[comment]:**7:23am** people slowly arrive, I'm talking to a few French speakers, exchanging about performances and predictions. From what I heard we should be able to finish in 6h max which is the cut off time. The landscape is not flat at all.

**8:11am** the event organizer from *environsports* is speaking to us, welcoming us and introducing the race path, the words up, up and up again are voiced over many times. One loop of 21km meaning I will have to do two loops.

I keep three visual memories of this race.

One is a quarter of the race relativery fine with a slope down where we could run fast without risks.

A second where one of the frenchies is passing me in another slope down, he is smilling, a few seconds later I see him doing an involontary stunt legs in the airs, smile is broken but he continues running behind me.

Third in the second loop after a third of the race. I'm at a refueling station and I'm so thirsty, drunk a lot, ate half a banana and continue. One runner is eating like crazy and leaving the station super fast. A few minutes later I will pass him while is puking like he never puke before.

[comment]:The beginning is pleasant and we can even run on the beach where the sand is still wett and solid at this time of the day.

[comment]:Then the fun is over, it starts to go up, my gps is lost and I'm following the orange color marks. I discover that you are allowed to walk up while trailing. I'm ok with that.

[comment]:A kind of a plateau is reached and the first slope going down, the path is fairly large and clean allowing us to run fast. A quarter of the run is done.

[comment]:The second slope arrives, we will call it the death slope because it is too steep. There are clouds, we are in the clouds and can't see the top of the hill where we are going.

[comment]:One of the frenchies is passing me in another slope down, he is smillied, a few seconds later I see him doing an involontary stunt, smile is broken but he continues running behind me.

[comment]:Finally a creast is reached, it's windy and the weather still fresh, but coming from Montreal end of March it is more than pleasant. Second ravito reached and the end of the first loop not too far.

[comment]:**10:47am** I'm in time and looking at my first trail experience I'm happy. 

[comment]:Back to the the nice slope down I have the first pains kicking in.

[comment]:At the refueling station I'm so thirsty. I ate half a banana and continue. One runner is eating like crazy and continue super fast. A few minutes later I will pass him while is puking like he never puke before.

Run, walk, run, walk and run again, pain. In the last km I managed to go over one or two runners. 

**1:23pm** it's over! **5h19** of race, I walked sometimes but never stop except for eating or drinking at the stations.

[comment]:I have a beautiful blister, I'm sun burned, I have cramps, my nipples are in pain and I did not get that in the two previous marathon, I also ran longer this time.

[comment]:In any ases happy to have finished that marathon trail, I will be more carefull next time I sign to a race.

# After the race

**4:50pm** I continue walking a few km to find network, catch a Uber, direction a beer in SF.

A mixed experienced about that race as I wasn't really trained for a trail. But running all winter in Montreal I was trained to run on not flat surfaces. Not sure I will sign up again for a trail.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
