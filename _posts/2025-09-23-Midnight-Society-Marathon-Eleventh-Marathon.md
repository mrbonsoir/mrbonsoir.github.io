# Enter the Midnight Society Marathon

The story is simple, twelve people, half of dozen cyclists, more support crew in a shady van with Ontarian plate, a megaphone and the marathon path almost ready 7hours 45minutes before the official start of the race. So yes, we did engage by choice in an unsanctioned marathon race following the Montreal marathon path, organized by [slowfastslow][slowfastslow613-link], starting Saturday at midnight.

# The Start Line

Confettis, smoke bombs and chaos right from the official marathon start line. It only took one bridge and a few meters to deviate from the official path… It was dark and one dude decided to run faster, we all followed him and missed the first turn… so we continued, passed by the taxi parking in front of the casino and found the island exit, the Concorde bridge and the official marathon path again, meaning at km 5 we did 3, so 2k we will have to added later.

The front pack is already flying and I‘m staying with the second half, after Habitat 67 and Farine Five Roses I teamed up with Judith, we continue together up to km 30, sometimes joined by others.

We passed the cathedral on Notre-Dame, the confused cyclist team found us again - remember the chaotic departure -  crossed briefly the Village by Ste-Catherine and turned on Berri direction North, park Lafontaine, zigzagging before Papineau to St-Joseph, to the West and full North from St-Laurent. We are four to five runners together, the cyclists never far and the shady van in place.

From  Park Jarry we are two again, relaying, it’s the fourth time I’m doing the MTL marathon and I get a few segment PR, by night. Judith is flying.

First half is going well, below two hours, we get support from cyclists - I can’t stop mentioning them - and I still have the image in head of the van and the driver asking on megaphone at 2am “do you need anything?” and then stopping in the middle of St-Laurent  after crossing Chabanel, the co-pilot running toward us with gels and drinks, I call it luxury ravito.

# The Never Ending Night Tunnel

City seems so empty, it’s late of course, but also weird to have for vision only the headlamp light in front of us balancing with the running movement, the impression to cross a tunnel, a long one. It’s bringing back memories of [Runk runs like the blue line][Runkseries-link] early in the morning, being alone in a city asleep.

We arrive at Ahunstic, do the loop, good place to see all runners, the one in front and behind us. Km 23 is passed and we are engaging again on the lovely St-Laurent, now going up full South.

We are a group of three runners Judith, Kay and I plus Nik on his bike with good electronic music, it helped me a lot to stick to the group. Getting close to 30Km is hard with heavy legs. We are getting close to 3am. A good time for asking yourself what the fuck am I doing?

I’m slowing down, using a red light between Jarry and Jean-Talon as an opportunity to stop and regroup with myself… and continue alone. At Km 32 while turning East on Beaubien I get cramps on both legs, pain. Also the moment the faster group that added the missing Km in Ahunstic is passing me. The time to chitchat with Butch on his bike - awake and counting all the runners as a knight Shepard - to see Marty and other runners. I’m stretching, slowly recovering my legs, also realizing I’m just 2km from home and had my keys on me… Yes the thought of going home did cross my mind, but I did not.

What follows is a bit cloudy in my head, I’m running on Terminator battery safety mode. I’m passed by faster runners, and Laurent on his bike continues on my side on St-Joseph towards the last 7Km. 

Big up to Om, Anatolie, Butch, Laurent, Nik, Jon, Nana, and more support crew I forgot the name, they were riding for at least 50 to 60 or more Km to assist us with delicious gels and drinks or screaming from the van with a megaphone.

To find the way it’s “easy”, just spot the streets empty of cars parked and more orange signs. But it’s fucking long and Montreal is full of orange signs.

3km left, another cyclist is joining my curse and stay with me until arriving on the Northern part of Park Maisonneuve, at the same moment I’m passed by a runner on steroids with a strong acceleration in the last hill. I walked a few meter and kicked myself to do the last stretched without stopping.

# The Finish Line

Along the park is so quiet, it’s soon 4am and I’m crossing another runner doing a loop to complete the marathon mileage. I’m entering the last meters, a security person is welcoming me and pointing me to the right direction, I passed the finish line and stop for a few seconds, checked my watch, only 41.3km… so I left for a mini loop to reach the 42.2km and crossed the finish line again, so many of us had to do the same. It’s 4:04am and it’s cold.

So cool to have finished, we are all stunned to have completed this race, cheering and high fiving each new arrival. We put fresh clothes on in addition to survival blanket, we all looked like Christmas gifts. I get a coke from the vip marathon fridge from the official marathon race director himself, probably the best coke I ever drink this year.

Nobody was lost! Now breakfast! The shady van is there for us, we managed to all fit in, kidnapping style. Next stop at Miami Deli where the cyclists all joined as well. The coffee is disgusting but the general mood of all people involved is at the opposite. Outside the sun is showing up and we can see a few runners going to the near subway station to do the actual marathon, it’s 6:15am ish.

I can barely walk, my legs are sore, but I’m super happy, it was so cool, surreal sometimes as marathon can be, even spiritual for that one. The people that made it possible are amazing, big thanks to all of them, so glad to have won the chance to participate to this extravaganza marathon and enter the Midnight Society Marathon.

# Epilog

We all leave the deli, I’m going home by subway which is full or runners going to the marathon departure. Back in my hood there are only squirrels ruling the streets. I managed to climb the stairs to my door, take a warm shower and a solid 45min nap. 

I woke up and cycled 20min to the closest cheering station at km 39km where I meet again some of the people I saw during the night. A few mimosas, one grill cheese, a lot of clapping and I go home again for more napping activities.

Add 30Km of bike for a few celebration beers in St-Henri and it’s time to lay down for real. Good thing I have a day off tomorrow.
