First running race of the season. It's still cold outside.

The race path is almost the same as last year, going from Parc Jean Drapeaux to the circuit Gilles Villeneuve and back to the parc.

# During the race

The difference with last year is that I'm running alone, but I follow a run group in which I know the pacer.

It went ok, I event got a mimosa at the cheer station. I thought I missed the drink but a Marty ran fast to follow we and gave me the holly mimosa. Most of that drink finished on my face.

At mid race I felt a bit weak and could not follow my pace group. It's too bad because it was a good wind protection.

Finally after some damage control I could limit my loss of time and finish in **1h46min53sec**. Not my best time but that's ok.

# After the race

I put some warmer clothes and stay to join the cheer squad. There are too more races coming, 5K and 10K and it's my turn to make some noise.

# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
