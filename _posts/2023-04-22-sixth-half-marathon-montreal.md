Last year I was part of the cheersquad on the circuit Gilles Villeneuve, but this year I'm registered as a runner. It's also my birthday, turning 47y old and it's the first time I'm running a race the day of my birthday.

# Day of the race

It's a good day for running, fresh but beautifull weather. I'm not running with an official pacer but with a running buddy having her birthday as well. Jackie is super nice, very fast and a regular of the [Run rite Althetics Crew][runrite-link] in Montreal.

It's a real pleasure to run with someone better than you, all along the race Jackie is talking to me, checking I'm alrigth, dodging the pace to see if we (I mean I) can follow the rythm.

Our goal is 1h45min and we manage to keep that speed. If the path is flat it's also very windy depending of the direction. We are going mostly South-North both on the Park Jean Drapeaux and the circuit Gilles Villeneuve, so targeting groups depending of the orientation is always a good idea to get wind protection.

In the last 2km we pass the 1h45min pacer, finishing before that group holding the speed when people are starting to walk.

# After the race

A final time of 1h44min, so we reached our goal and I'm very happy about it.


# Map of the race

Using [folium][folium-link] I managed to overlay the gps run traces on the top of a map, and you can interactively zoom in and out.
